<h2>The Worldpay Within Architecture</h2>

<h3>Quick intro</h3>

<p>To complement the Architecture we have released the Worldpay Within SDK. The intention for of the SDK is to encapsulate implementation and therefore assist third party vendors and developers in integration into their IoT solutions.</p>

<p>The core of the SDK is developed in the Go programming language with wrappers created for Java, Node.JS, Python 2.7, Pyhton 3.0 and .net(C#). Service delivery and broadcast have been implemented using TCP/IP networking.</p>

<p><a href="sample-service-messaging.html">Please note the low level service messaging json spec can be found here</a></p>

<h3>Architecture Overview</h3>

<p>In the IoT, each Thing will perform the function it is designed for be it
acting as a sensor, or a controller or both. In order for Thing to be
able to make and receive payments for services they can provide to other
Things, they need to add the payments functionality contained in
Worldpay Within.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><figure>
<img src="images/architecture/worldpayWithinFig1.png" alt="Worldpay Within Pluggable agent">
<figcaption>Figure 1. Worldpay Within Pluggable agent.</figcaption>
</figure></div>

<p>Things in the IoT will be implemented on
dedicated low cost processor systems. The Thing and Worldpay Within must
co-exist and operate on the resources provided by these devices, as
demonstrated in Figure 2.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><figure>
<img src="images/architecture/logicalOverview.png" alt="Logical Overview">
<figcaption>Figure 2. Worldpay Within Logical Overview.</figcaption>
</figure></div>

<p>In order to make and receive payments in the IoT, a Thing must be able
to perform the roles of “consumer”, to make a payment for services, and
the “merchant”, to receive a payment for provision of services. In the
Worldpay Within IoT architecture, the “consumer” pays for services by
supporting Host Card Emulation (HCE). The “merchant” receives payments
for services by supporting Host Terminal Emulation (HTE). Worldpay
Within contains both an HCE Brain &amp; HTE Brain functionalities, ensuring
a Thing can both consume and supply services. These services are
provided through a series of public APIs, described within this
document.</p>

<p>HCE and HTE require the secure storage and use of the credentials during
the payments process. This necessitates the use of secure processing
within the Thing in a “Secure Execution Environment”.</p>

<p>For HCE Things, these credentials include the details of the “card”
which the payment will be made from. For HTE Things, these credentials
include the details the Merchant requires to perform transactions in
Online.worldpay.com.</p>

<p>As well as the provision of the payment for the services, Worldpay
Within provides for the generation and validation of secure service
tokens, which allow for services to be consumed in part or together, but
separately from the payments functionality.</p>


<!--
<h2 id="secure-messaging">Secure Messaging</h2>

<p>Online.worldpay.com provides a secure payments interface with devices
connecting to Online.worldpay.com using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
The payment process involves the sending of payment credentials to
Online.worldpay.com from the IoT Thing. In order to ensure the
credentials are not exposed, the IoT Thing must ensure that these
credentials are only available within a Secure Execution Environment
(SEE) within the Thing, and that they are protected at all points
between the SEE and Online.worldpay.com. There are several architecture
considerations <img src="media/image4.emf" alt="">to achieving this security, as shown in
Figure 2, dependent on the platform chosen for the IoT Thing.</p>

<p>Ideally the TLS connection would be secured from within the SEE, however
this may not be possible due to the hardware constraints. In this case,
the implementation of TLS within the Thing should be split to ensure
that the data encryption services are performed from within the SEE. If
this is not possible, then a P2PE service layer may be required to
secure the data from the SEE to Online.worldpay.com.</p>

<h3 id="credential-provisioning">Credential provisioning</h3>

<p>When each IoT Brain is personalised with its Online.worldpay.com payment
credentials, the card details should be Tokenised and channel restricted
to Online.worldpay.com.</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>Devices used in the IoT are lower end processors with limited processing
power and memory. In order to minimise the impact on the device,
implementations of Worldpay Within for IoT devices will be programmed in
C or C# language.</p>

<p>The messaging shall be based on Java Script Object Notation (JSON)[^2]
rather than the more common (e.g. EMV) Application Protocol Data Units
(APDU) as the project will already need to use JSON to communicate with
Online.worldpay.com REST-full[^3] back end. There are a number of
implementations of JSON available in C or C# suitable for the proposed
IoT platforms.</p>
-->

<h3>Worldpay Within IoT Service Architeture</h3>

<p>The
provision of a service within the Worldpay IoT system is performed in 4
phases, as shown in Figure 4, these being: Service Discovery; Service
Negotiation; Payment; and Service Delivery. Each of these phases are
described in the following sections.</p>


<div style="text-align: center;"><figure>
<img src="images/architecture/serviceOverview.png" alt="The 4 phases of Worldpay Within">
<figcaption>Figure 4. The 4 phases of Worldpay Within.</figcaption>
</figure></div>









<h4 id="service-discovery">Service Discovery</h4>

<p>Each Thing that offers services, the service ‘supplier’ shall broadcast
it’s list of available services, as shown in Figure 4 below. When a
potential ‘consumer’ of the service connects with ‘supplier’ it can
request details of the services offered.</p>

<p>Providing a suitable service is
discovered, the consumer then requests the service from the supplier,
and price negotiations can begin.</p>



<div style="text-align: center;"><figure>

<tr><td>broadcast</td><td>server_UUID</td><td>Advertising services and identifying the sender</td></tr>
<tr><td>request services</td><td>none</td><td>Request a list of all services</td></tr>
<tr><td>services_response</td><td>list of services, server_UUID</td><td>Provide client with a list of possible services that the sender can provide</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="service-discovery-messages">Service discovery messages</h4>

<p>A broadcast message that includes Thing B’s UUID is sent.</p>

<p>Upon receiving the message Thing A connects to Thing B and requests the
list of available services.</p>

<p>Thing B responds with a list identifying the services available.</p>











<h2 id="service-negotiation">Service Negotiation</h2>

<p>Once a suitable service has been
discovered, there will be a price negotiation. The provider may offer
the same service at different rates depending on the number of units of
service to be purchased. The process is outlined in Figure 5. The
outcome of the process is an agreement to purchase an amount of service
and a total price for the service to be provided. The service provider
can then request payment for the agreed service and price.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><figure>

<tr><td>price_select_response</td><td>price_id, number_of_units, total_price, server_UUID, client_UUID, payment_ref_ID, Merchant_Client_key</td><td>Communicate the expected total price to the client.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>








<h4 id="service-negotiation-messages">Service negotiation messages</h4>

<p>A price request is sent containing the selected service_id.</p>

<p>The response from Thing B contains a list of price items; each item
should contain a price_id, per unit price, unit_ID and description
fields of both the unit and the price.</p>

<p>Thing A then selects an appropriate price_id by sending a request with
its client_UUID, the selected service_id, the price_id, and the
number of items required.</p>

<p>If the number of items falls within the correct number of items for the
price selected, then Thing B responds with a price select response
containing the service_id, price_id, the total price, the
service_UUID and a reference for the payment and its Merchant Client
key. Otherwise Thing B shall return the number of units it can supply
along with the correct price, and additional details required to
initiate the payment.</p>

<h4 id="payment">Payment</h4>

<p>The payment process with Online.worldpay.com is a two stage process,
split between the consumer and merchant Things involved in the
transaction, these stages are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Client Token Request, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payment Authorisation Request. (Also known as Order Request)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>During the first stage, the consumer sends Online.worldpay.com their
payment credentials and the merchants Client Key. Online.worldpay.com
returns a Client Token, which the consumer passes to the Merchant,
allowing the merchant to perform the payment authorisation request with
Online.worldpay.com by providing the Client Token and transaction
details.</p>

<p>This payment process ensures that the consumer does not pass their
payment credentials to the merchant, only to Online.worldpay.com.</p>

<h4 id="client-token-request">Client token request</h4>

<p>The first step in the payment process is
when Thing A receives the Merchant_Client_Key from Thing B. Thing B
passes their public Client Key to Thing A as part of the
price_select_response during the Service Negotiation phase. Upon
receiving the Client Key from Thing B, Thing A connects with
Online.worldpay.com to request the client token from
Online.worldpay.com. This request includes Thing A’s payment
credentials: Card PAN, expiry, and the client_key of Thing B.
Online.worldpay.com will respond with a message that includes a
client_token. This is shown in Figure 7.</p>

</tbody>
</table>



<p>Thing A will connect to Online.worldpay.com using TLS. It will then
request a client_token by securely (see 2.2.1) sending a JSON message
containing the paymentMethod, its payment credentials (PAN, expiry) to
Online.worldpay.com along with the client_ key from Thing B. In
addition a flag indicating if the client details can be used in future
is sent, for IoT this should always be set ‘reusable’:’false’ in order
to force generation of a new client token for each transaction.</p>

<p>A successful response will be an HTTP POST response containing fields:
client_token, reusable_flag and the payment_method_response. Once
received, the client_token shall be passed to Thing B</p>

<p>A sample request is shown in Appendix B: Sample Service Messaging.</p>

<p>See Online.worldpay.com documentation for client_token_request &amp;
client_token_repsonse APIs data descriptions.</p>

<h4 id="payment-authorisation-request">Payment authorisation request</h4>

<p>Thing B will process the order and request the payment from
Online.worldpay.com providing its Service key, client_token,
transaction currency and payment amount. This is transmitted to
Online.worldpay.com over TLS. After successful processing
Online.worldpay.com will provide a payment response. Thing B shall then
generate a service token, which Thing A may use in future to obtain the
services that the payment has been made for. This is shown in Figure 7.</p>

<p>Thing B shall assemble a message to be posted to Online.worldpay.com
that contains the client token, Service key, the amount, currency and
transaction description. Online.worldpay.com shall then perform an
authorisation using the payment credentials identified by the
client_token. A successful authorisation will result in a
payment_status of SUCCESS being returned to Thing B.</p>

<tr><td>payment_request_response</td><td>service_delivery_token, server_UUID, client_UUID, total_paid</td><td>service_delivery_token is passed to ThingB.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>










<p>Thing B shall then generate a cryptographically secure
service_delivery_token, which can be used by Thing A to request
provision of services from Thing B.</p>

<h3 id="service-delivery">Service Delivery</h3>

<p>Once the payment has been made, Thing B
shall return to broadcasting its available services. Thing A will now be
able to consume the service from Thing B by providing the
service_delivery_token. The service delivery may be in a single step,
or over time. An overview of service delivery is shown in Figure 8.</p>



<div style="text-align: center;"><figure>
<img src="images/architecture/serviceDelivery.png" alt="Service delivery">
<figcaption>Figure 8. Service delivery.</figcaption>
</figure></div>



<p>Once in possession of a service_token, Thing A may then request the
service be provided. The service could be consumed in one session, or in
several sessions over time, depending on the nature of the service and
number of units purchased. Thing A may repeatedly send service delivery
requests until Thing B indicates that the service has been delivered.</p>

<h4 id="service-delivery-apis">Service Delivery APIs</h4>



<table>

<p>Thing A sends a message with the service_delivery_token to Thing B,
along with the amount of service it wishes to consume. The response
shall confirm the amount of service units that Thing B can supply to
Thing A at that time. Once the service has been delivered, Thing A shall
confirm the amount of service units it has received, with Thing B
responding, stating the number of units still remaining to Thing A, if
any.</p>
