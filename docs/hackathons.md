## Payments & IoT Hackathons

### 3-6 November 2017 - Bucharest, Romania hackathon, featuring Worldpay Within

In November 2017, we hosted our first ever hackathon in Bucharest, Romania. Using the Internet of Things as the basis of the challenge, developers were given the task of using Worldpay's very own Worldpay Within SDK to build software that could make payments between two smart devices.

### February 2017 - Atlanta hackathon, featuring Worldpay Within

Worldpay US was a sponsor of the ATDC Fintech Hackathon, a weekend in which 18 teams competed in a battle to demonstrate how well they integrated either Worldpay or TSYS APIs into their own applications.

### September 2016 - Our Inaugral Payments & Iot hackathon

Worldpay's Technology Innovation team held their first Internet of Things (IoT) hackathon at the Impact Hub in Westminster, London. It was the first time they'd hosted a hackathon and it was attended by over 80 technologists and experienced coders, who came together to explore use-cases for exciting mobile payments and new IoT open-source technology.

Over the weekend participants brought to life a range of innovative concepts from building a payment system following a natural disaster, to payments apps for the sharing economy.
