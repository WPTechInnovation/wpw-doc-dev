In November, we're hosting our latest IoT and Payments hackathon, based on Worldpay Within. We're delighted to be hosting this in the beautiful Bucharest, Romania. More details will be coming soon. 

This time it's all about Worldpay Within on Raspberry Pis, with the theme focusing on smart home, smart cities and smart living. We've got some really exciting sponsors, which we will also be announcing soon. We've also got awesome cash prizes for the 3 winning teams.

### February 2017 - Atlanta hackathon, featuring Worldpay Within

Worldpay US was a sponsor of the ATDC Fintech Hackathon, a weekend in which 18 teams competed in a battle to demonstrate how well they integrated either Worldpay or TSYS APIs into their own applications.

### September 2016 - Our Inaugral Payments & Iot hackathon

Worldpay's Technology Innovation team held their first Internet of Things (IoT) hackathon at the Impact Hub in Westminster, London. It was the first time they'd hosted a hackathon and it was attended by over 80 technologists and experienced coders, who came together to explore use-cases for exciting mobile payments and new IoT open-source technology.

Over the weekend participants brought to life a range of innovative concepts from building a payment system following a natural disaster, to payments apps for the sharing economy.
