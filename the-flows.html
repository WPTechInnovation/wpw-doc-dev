                              <h3>The Flows</h3>

                              <!--<p>There are certain flows that are allowable for the consumer and producer, and this flow should be adhered to when utilising the Worldpay Within SDK. What follows is a diagram of the flow, and then a detailed breakdown of the steps of the flows, what they do; and explicitly the order in which they should be followed.</p>

                              <p>The devices are not synchronised by the SDK in any way - so it is up to the developer of the app that sits on top of the SDK to call the Worldpay Within API in the correct order. This is the responsibility of the developer. However if the order below is adhered to then the outcome of the functionality will be as desired.</p>-->
                              <p>We recommend following the below flows for consumer and producer devices. You can find a breakdown in each of the <a href="#steps">steps below.</a></p>
                              <p>The devices are not synchronised by the SDK, so you'll need to ensure that the SDKs call the Worldpay Within API in the correct order. If you follow the steps below, then the outcome should be as expected.</p>
